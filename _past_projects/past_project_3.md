title: "An Optimized Human-Machine Intelligence Framework for Classification (NSF CISE CORE PROGRAM)"
# excerpt: "Short description of portfolio item number 1<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
excerpt: "The goal of this project is to develop an optimized human-machine intelligence framework for single and multi-label classification problems through active learning. The focus is on citizen science based cyber-human systems that collect species observation information for ecological applications, but the findings will apply more broadly. It will adapt several existing active learning techniques for single and multi-label classification, but study them in the context of crowdsourcing, especially considering worker-centric optimization. The innovations lie in systematically characterizing variables to model human factors, designing optimization models that appropriately combine system and worker-centric goals, and discovering innovative solutions. The project describes an iterative framework that judiciously employs human workers to collect labels, which, in turn, are used by the supervised machine algorithms to make intelligent predictions.
