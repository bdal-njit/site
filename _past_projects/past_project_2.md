title: "PPoSS Planning Grant: Streamware - A Scalable Framework for Accelerating Streaming Data Science, (National Science Foundation) "
# excerpt: "Short description of portfolio item number 1<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
excerpt: "Modern data-science applications are characterized as being highly decentralized, distributed and requiring composition and orchestration between localized analytics on thousands or millions of edge platforms and massive centralized analytics in cloud/data centers, as well as requiring real-time analytics on streaming data. To enable scalable performance of grand-challenge streaming data-science applications, a framework that allows developers to seamlessly build these applications targeting a wide variety of scalable systems is needed. This planning project is conducting preliminary research towards a large proposal for developing an open source framework, StreamWare, that will enable users to develop streaming data-science applications.<br>point to this website: <a href='https://streamware.org/'>https://streamware.org/</a>"
